Always opens up a specific page or post in HTML mode to preserve HTML code.

== Description ==

If you find yourself entering HTML code into the WordPress page/post editor only to have it reformatted or worse removed when in Visual mode then here is the solution for you.

Always Edit In HTML is a WordPress plugin that removes the "Visual" tab in the page/post editor and opens up your page or post in HTML mode, preserving your HTML code.

*Why would you need this plugin?*

The WordPress page/post editor has two tabs at the top right - "Visual" and "Text".

   1. The HTML tab allows you to enter HTML code onto the page or post and when saving or publishing the post it preserves your code just the way you entered it.
   2. The Visual tab has all the fancy writing style tools but when you save or publish your page or post, WordPress parses and formats the content which may results in your HTML code not working or even being removed.

WordPress does not remember the tab option for each page or post.  It will open up a page or post using whichever Visual or HTML tab you last used.

This means that if you were editing a post using the Visual tab, saved it and then edited the page or post you had entered the HTML code into, that page would open in Visual mode and you could loose your HTML code.

If only there was a plugin that gave you the option to always open up a page or post in HTML

Ta da!  Here's one.

= Plugin Page =
[Always Edit In HTML](http://www.limecanvas.com/wordpress-plugins/always-edit-in-html-wordpress-plugin/ "Always Edit In HTML WordPress Plugin")

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin zip file & unzip it
2. Copy the folder always-edit-in-html into the directory /wp-content/plugins/ 
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Open up a page, post or publicly declared custom post type and you will now see the "Always Edit In HTML" option box on the right column.

Check the option and save.

Next time you open the same page or post it will open up in HTML mode, removing the "Visual" and "Text" tabs.

Uncheck the option at any time to get the "Visual" and "Text" buttons and default opening behaviour back.
